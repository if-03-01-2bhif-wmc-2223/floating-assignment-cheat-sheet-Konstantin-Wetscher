        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> html </strong>  <br />
            <strong> 1) Basics: </strong> <br />
            If you want to see the basics just scroll up and read. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 2) html elements: </strong> <br />
            There are quite a few html elements for example: html, body, h1, p. There are the so called "void elements" (area, br, col, embed, img) <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 3) Attribute: </strong>  <br />
            All html elements have attributes. <br />
            An Attribute can provide additional information about elements. <br />
            All Attributes are allways specified in the start tag. <br />
            An Attribute usually comes in paires of name/value <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 4) Headings: </strong> <br />
            Headings are typically defined with h1 to h6, they can enlargen a given text (given meaning inbetween the tags) <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 5) Paragraph: </strong> <br />
            A Paragraph can be done with the p tag. Given the display of the viewer, your Html text will change, it´ll either enlarge oder shrink. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 6) Comments: </strong> <br />
            A comment in html can be written with <!.-.-. -.-.->. (Points are only there so it won´t turn into an actual comment.) Comments won´t be displayed on your website, however they can help to sort your <code class=""></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 7) Links: </strong> <br />
            Links in html codes are referred to as hyperlinks. By clicking on a link you can jump to a different document. If you have already clicked on a link, it will turn purple, if left alone it should be light blue. A picture can be linked with a "href"  <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 8) Images: </strong> <br />
            Images are either linked with a href or a img src tag. With the img tag you can embed an image in a web page. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 9) Head: </strong> <br />
            The head tag is a container for you metadata (which is data about data) its placed between your html and body tag. Metadata isn`t displayed and is only data about your HTML document. <br />
            The title tag, just as its name suggests, is the title of the document. It´s text-only and is only shown on the brower´s title bar on the top. The title is one of the required elements in a html document. <br />
            The meta tag is used to specify the character set. (page description, keywords, author of the document and viewport settings).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Css </strong>  <br />
            <strong> 1) Syntax: </strong> <br />
            The syntax of an css consists of a selector and a declaration block. In the declaration block there are one or more declarations, which are seperated by a colon. <br />
            A grouping selector can be used to select multiple elements, so you can style and edit them together. <br />
            In a css the comments are startet with a / * and end with * /. It has the same usage as a comment in html. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 2) Colours: </strong> <br />
            In css you can change the colour property of an element. For specifying the colour you use colour values, it can be changed with the following ways: RGB Format, RGBA Format, Hexadecimal Notation, HSL, HSLA or Built-in-colour. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 3) Backgrounds: </strong> <br />
            The background properties can be used to add effects for elements. <br />
            There are 5 different points which i´ll be describing. <br />

            - Background-Color <br />
            As the name suggests the property specifies the color of an element. <br /> 

            - Background-Image <br />
            This property specifies an image that you can as a background. <br />

            - Background-Repeat <br />
            This property repeats, a picture, both horizontally and vertically. <br />

            -Background-Attachment <br />
            The attachment property specifies wether the image in the background, should croll or be in a fixed state (not scroll with the rest). <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 4) Text: </strong> <br />
            With the colour property of an element, you can set the colour of the given text. <br />
            The text-alighn property, can change the horizontal alignment of a text. It can centered, left-aligned or right-aligned. <br />
            Using the text-decoration-line property, can add a decoration to your line of text. You can combine more than one value. <br />
            Next up is the text-transformation property. It´s used to specify either lowercase or uppercase letters in a text. You can use it to turn everything in a text into uppercase or lowercase and only capitalize the first letter of each word. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 5) Fonts: </strong> <br />
            Theres a wide variety of fonts to add to your css. For Example there are: Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospace, Cursive and Fantasy. <br />
            The difference between Sans-Serif and Serif is pretty simple. Serif has little strokes at the edges of letters, while Sans-Serif just have clean lines. <br />
            Using the font-family property can specify the font of a text. Its used with the values mentioned above. <br />
            The font-style propterty mostly specifies italic text. It has three different values: normal, italic and oblique. <br />
            With the font-size property you can change the size of your given text. You can either change the size of an text with Pixels or Em (16 Px = 1 Em) <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 6) Links: </strong> <br />
            You can styke a link with any css property (background, font-family, colour, etc.). In addition to that, links can have different styles depending in what state they are. There are 4 stages: a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> 7) Combinators: </strong> <br />
            With combinators you can describe the relationship between selectors. There can be more than one simple selectors in a css selectors. There are 4 different combinators: descendant selector (space), child selector (>), adjacent sibling selector (+), general sibling selector (~). <br />
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <strong> 8) Pseudo Classes: </strong> <br />
            Using a pseudo class can define a special state of an element. For Example: When a User hovers over it, changing the look of unvisited and visited links and focusing on elements. <br />
            With Anchor Pseudo-classes there is a defined syntax. You HAVE to write a:hover AFTER a:link and a:visited <br />
        </p>

            Start with the element name, afterwards write a dot (.), which again is followed by the name of given class.
            These classes can also be refered to more than once by HTML elements. <br />
                - With the #id selector certain elements, with the specified id, are styled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3><strong> Css Box Model </strong></h3>

            <strong>- Border: </strong> A Border that just goes around the content and padding. <br />

            <strong>- right: </strong> The element is now on the right of its container. <br />

            <strong>Lossless / Supported Comperssion:</strong> PNG has a lossless Compression with GIF and MP4 <br />
            GIF is a good choice for graphics because of their limited numbers of colors, which is supported by a lossless compression; <br />
            PNG is also a good choice for graphics that require transperency, because of their transparent backgrounds. <br />
            ICO is a great choice for icons, because ots specialized fpr icons. <br />
            And SVG is another good choice for graphics, because if theres something that needs to be scaled it will be because its a scaleable vector graphic format <br />
            MPEG / MP4 are great choices for motions captures because they support videos. <br />
